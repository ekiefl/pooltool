class System:
    """A class representing the billiards system.

    This class holds:

    (1) a collection of balls (:class:`pooltool.objects.ball.datatypes.Ball`)
    (2) a cue stick (:class:`pooltool.objects.cue.datatypes.Cue`)
    (3) a table (:class:`pooltool.objects.table.datatypes.Table`)

    Together, these objects, referred to as the `system`, fully describe the billiards
    system.

    This object is a mutable object that can be evolved over the course of system's
    evolution. When a billiards system is simulated, a list of
    :class:`pooltool.events.datatypes.Event` objects is stored in this class.

    This class also stores the duration of simulated time elapsed as ``t``, measured in
    seconds.

    Attributes:
        cue:
            A cue stick.
        table:
            A table.
        balls:
            A dictionary of balls.

            Warning:
                Each key must match each value's ``id`` (`e.g.` ``{"2": Ball(id="1")}``
                is invalid).

            Note:
                If, during construction, a sequence (`e.g.` list, tuple, etc.) of balls
                is passed instead of a dictionary, it will be converted to a dictionary.
        t:
            The elapsed simulation time. If the system is in the process of being
            simulated, ``t`` is updated to be the number of seconds the system has
            evolved. After being simulated, ``t`` remains at the final simulation time.
        events:
            The sequence of events in the simulation. Like ``t``, this is updated
            incrementally as the system is evolved. (*default* = ``[]``)

    Examples:

        Constructing a system requires a cue, a table, and a dictionary of balls:

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> pt.System(
        >>>     cue=pt.Cue.default(),
        >>>     table=pt.Table.default(),
        >>>     balls={"1": pt.Ball.create("1", xy=(0.2, 0.3))},
        >>> )

        If you need a quick system to experiment with, call :meth:`example`:

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> system = pt.System.example()

        You can simulate this system and introspect its attributes:

        >>> pt.simulate(system, inplace=True)
        >>> system.simulated
        True
        >>> len(system.events)
        14
        >>> system.cue

    Example:

        This example illustrates the basics of multisystems.

        First, make a system and evolve it.

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> system = pt.System.example()
        >>> system.strike(phi=90)
        >>> pt.simulate(system, inplace=True)

        Now add it to a multisystem.

        >>> multisystem = pt.MultiSystem()
        >>> multisystem.append(system)

        Now copy the system, reset it's history, strike it differently, simulate it, and
        add it to the mulisystem:

        >>> next_system = multisystem[-1].copy()
        >>> next_system.strike(phi=0)
        >>> pt.simulate(next_system, inplace=True)
        >>> multisystem.append(next_system)

        The multisystem has a length,

        >>> len(multisystem)
        2

        supports basic indexing,

        >>> multisystem[0].t
        6.017032496778012

        and can be iterated through:

        >>> for shot in multisystem: print(len(shot.events))
        15
        10

        Now visualize the multisystem:
