def continuize(system: System, dt: float = 0.01, inplace: bool = False) -> System:
    """Create a ``BallHistory`` for each ball with many timepoints

    When pooltool simulates a shot, it evolves the system using an `event-based shot
    evolution algorithm
    <https://ekiefl.github.io/2020/12/20/pooltool-alg/#continuous-event-based-evolution>`_.
    This means pooltool only timestamps the ball states during events--not between
    events. This makes simulation fast, but provides insufficient trajectory information
    if you wanted to visualize or plot ball trajectories over time.

    *Continuizing* the shot means tracking the ball states with higher temporal
    resolution, so that the ball trajectories between events can be recapitulated. It's
    a misnomer because the states are still tracked over discrete time steps ``dt``
    seconds apart. *i.e.* not continuous.

    This function calculates the "continous" timestamps for each ball and stores them in
    :attr:`pooltool.objects.ball.datatypes.Ball.history_cts` (the event-based timestamps
    are preserved, and are stored in
    :attr:`pooltool.objects.ball.datatypes.Ball.history`)

    The continous timepoints are shared between all balls and are uniformly spaced
    (except for the last timepoint, which occurs at the final event, which necessarily
    occurs less than ``dt`` after the second last timepoint).

    Args:
        dt:
            This is the spacing between each timepoint. 0.01 looks visually accurate at
            60fps at a playback speed of 1. Function runtime is inversely proportional
            to dt.
        inplace:
            By default, a copy of the passed system is continuized and returned. This
            leaves the passed system unmodified. If inplace is set to True, the passed
            system is modified in place, meaning no copy is made and the returned system
            is the passed system. For a more practical distinction, see Examples below.

    Examples:
        Standard usage:

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> system = pt.simulate(pt.System.example())

        The system has been simulated, so their ``history`` attributes are populated:

        >>> len(system.balls["cue"].history)
        14
        >>> system.balls["cue"].history[0]
        BallState(rvw=array([[0.4953  , 0.9906  , 0.028575],
               [0.      , 0.      , 0.      ],
               [0.      , 0.      , 0.      ]]), s=0, t=0.0)
        >>> system.balls["cue"].history[-1]
        BallState(rvw=array([[0.7464286761774921, 1.247940272192023 , 0.028575          ],
               [0.                , 0.                , 0.                ],
               [0.                , 0.                , 0.                ]]), s=0, t=5.193035203405666)

        However, the system has not been continuized, so their ``history_cts`` attributes are empty:

        >>> len(system.balls["cue"].history_cts)
        0

        After continuizing, the continuous ball histories are populated with many timestamps:

        >>> continuized_system = pt.continuize(system, inplace=False)
        >>> continuized_system.continuized
        True
        >>> len(continuized_system.balls["cue"].history_cts)
        523

        You can also modify the system in place:

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> system = pt.simulate(pt.System.example())
        >>> continuized_system = pt.continuize(system, inplace=True)
        >>> assert system.continuized
        >>> assert continuized_system.continuized
        >>> assert system is continuized_system

        Notice that the returned system *is* the continuized system. Therefore, there is
        no point catching the return object when inplace is True:

        >>> import pooltool as pt
        >>> system = pt.simulate(pt.System.example())
        >>> assert not system.continuized
        >>> pt.continuize(system, inplace=True)
        >>> assert system.continuized
