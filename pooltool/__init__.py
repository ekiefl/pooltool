"""The top-level API for the pooltool library

**Important and highly used objects are placed in this top-level API**. For example,
``System`` can be imported directly from the top module:

    >>> import pooltool as pt
    >>> system = pt.System.example()

Alternatively, it can be imported directly from its lower-level API location:

    >>> from pooltool.system import System
    >>> system = System.example()

If the object you're looking for isn't in this top-level API, **search for it in
the subpackages/submodules** listed below. Relatedly, if you believe that an objects deserves to
graduate to the top-level API, **your input is valuable** and such changes can be
considered.
