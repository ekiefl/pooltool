# Overview

Pooltool is a general **purpose billiards simulator** crafted specifically for science and engineering.

Its core design principles focus on speed, flexibility, and the ease of visualization and analysis. With an interactive 3D interface, a robust API, and extensive documentation, pooltool aims to be a **systemic tool in billiards-related research**. Continuously evolving through active maintenance and bolstered by a growing community, this vision for pooltool emphasizes not just its current capabilities, but also its potential for growth and adaptation within billiards simulation.

Pooltool is peer-reviewed and published in the **Journal of Open Source Software** (JOSS) and **pyOpenSci**.
