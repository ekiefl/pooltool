# Summary

All the examples are jupyter notebooks.

## Considerations

* `make docs` does not execute notebooks--it renders them as is.
* `make notebooks` executes all notebooks in this directory.
* If you want to add a notebook to the documentation, run `make notebooks`, then add it to `index.md`.
