# Quartic root test data generation

This directory contains ground truth data for testing quartic equation solvers.

## Overview

The ground truth data consists of:

- `quartic_coeffs.npy` - Quartic polynomial coefficients (standard cases)
- `quartic_coeffcoeffs.roots.npy` - Ground truth roots for standard cases
- `hard_quartic_coeffs.npy` - Quartic polynomial coefficients (pathological cases)
- `hard_quartic_coeffs.roots.npy` - Ground truth roots for pathological cases
- `hard_quartic_coeffs.cases.npy` - Case labels indicating which pathological scenario each coefficient set represents

## Generation method

The data is generated by `_generate_quartic_coeffs.py` using a reverse approach: start with known roots, then compute the exact polynomial coefficients. Coefficients are computed using `mpmath` at 100 decimal places of precision to avoid introducing numerical errors during coefficient generation. For a quartic with roots x1, x2, x3, x4:

```
c4 = 1
c3 = -(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)
c2 = x1x2 + (x1 + x2)(x3 + x4) + x3x4
c1 = -(x1x2(x3 + x4) + x3x4(x1 + x2))
c0 = x1x2x3x4
```

This ensures the ground truth roots are exact within floating-point precision, and any errors in test results are due to the solver being tested, not the test data.

## Regenerating data

To regenerate the test data:

```bash
python _generate_quartic_coeffs.py 1000 --output-file quartic_coeffs.npy
python _generate_quartic_coeffs.py 1000 --output-file hard_quartic_coeffs.npy --diabolical
```

The seed is fixed for reproducibility.
