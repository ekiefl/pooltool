## Code adherence

Style and code integrity in pooltool are maintained automatically through a combination of pre-commit hooks and continuous integration (CI) processes. These tools ensure that all contributions adhere to our coding standards and pass necessary tests before they can be integrated into the main branch.

### pre-commit

Pooltool utilizes the pre-commit framework to automatically reformat code upon committing, ensuring consistency and adherence to coding standards. If your code is reformatted during the commit process, review the changes made by pre-commit and add any modified files to your commit before proceeding.

### pre-merge

Pooltool utilizes continuous integration (CI) tools through GitHub workflows to ensure every pull request meets the project's quality and testing standards before it can be merged. Upon creating a pull request, automated tests are run to check for any issues. Contributors are expected to resolve any failing checks or tests highlighted by the CI process.
